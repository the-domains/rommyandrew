The full moon blooms brightly with generous fulfillment as the earth worm stirs in tender nourishment

A familiar dialect remembers in our hearts as it swiftly swirls unhindered on our perfect lips

With renewal and affirmed dedication, lustrous and mysterious tints of all shades polish our eyes

By fingertip to toe, head to heal, and heart to mind, our body discovers the ultimate conduit

A shimmering truth undresses, brilliantly unmoved by the tussle of the shadows cast by the tide
